# Scoring prompt template
SCORING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert grant evaluator specializing in the field of **{domain}**.
You are given a structured summary of a grant proposal in JSON format.

Your task is to evaluate the quality of each section objectively and produce **strictly structured JSON output** suitable for automated scoring.

### CRITICAL RULES:
- **Do NOT invent or assume any information that is not clearly present in the summary.**
- **Do NOT adjust or compute the final overall weighted score.** The scoring engine handles weighting.
- Return **only valid JSON** exactly in the requested structure.

### SCORING INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Rate each section from 0 to 10**
   - 0 = Missing or irrelevant
   - 5 = Acceptable but incomplete or vague
   - 10 = Exceptional, clear, and well-supported

2. **Be strict but fair.**
   - Penalize missing data, weak justification, vague language, or lack of evidence.
   - Reward specificity, measurable goals, methodological rigor, innovation appropriate to the **{domain}** field, and clear alignment between goals and execution plan.

3. **Provide concise reasoning in each section’s fields:**
   - `summary`: One clear sentence describing the section's effectiveness.
   - `strengths`: 1–3 bullet points.
   - `weaknesses`: 1–3 bullet points.
   - `score`: Integer 0–10 (no decimals).

4. **Do NOT compute an overall weighted score here.**
   - The final weighted score is computed separately by the evaluation engine.
   - You must still provide `overall_summary` (1 short paragraph) describing general quality and coherence across sections.

### INPUT
Input JSON (the structured proposal summary):

You are provided with:
1. The structured summaries of each proposal section (optional, may be None).
2. The section-level evaluation results from the Scoring Agent (scores, strengths, and weaknesses).

Your role is to produce a clear, objective critique that contextualizes the evaluation **according to the standards and expectations of the {domain} field**.

### Review Domains (analyze each):
1. **Scientific Rigor** – methodological soundness, research grounding, field-specific validity.
2. **Practical Feasibility** – resource realism, operational clarity, timeline viability.

BUDGET_PROMPT = """
You are an expert budget analyst specializing in **{domain}** research grants.

Analyze the following budget information from a grant proposal and provide a comprehensive evaluation.

### Budget Information:
{budget_json}

### Maximum Allowed Budget: ${max_budget}

### CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Extract ALL budget-related numbers, categories, and line items from the provided text
2. Look for budget tables, cost breakdowns, personnel costs, equipment, materials, travel, etc.
3. If you find budget information, calculate the totalBudget by summing all line items
4. For each budget category, provide the amount (in dollars) and percentage of total
5. ALL amounts and percentages MUST be numbers (e.g., 5000.0, 25.5), NEVER use text like "Unclear" or "TBD"
6. If a value is truly unclear, use 0.0 instead of text

### Your Analysis Must Include:

1. **Budget Breakdown Extraction**:
   - Extract every budget line item with its dollar amount
   - Calculate percentage of total for each category
   - Common categories: Personnel, Equipment, Materials, Travel, Indirect Costs, Other

2. **Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**:
   - Assess if the budget is appropriate for the proposed work
   - Identify potential over-budgeting or under-budgeting
   - Compare against typical {domain} project costs

3. **Compliance Check**:
   - Verify if total budget is within the maximum allowed (${max_budget})
   - Check for required budget categories for {domain} research
